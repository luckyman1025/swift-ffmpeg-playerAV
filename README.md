# swift-ffmpeg

## What ?

A basic bare bones audio player that demonstrates the basics of decoding audio with ffmpeg for the purpose of real-time playback. The code is in Swift 
and the demo project will run on macOS, but could prove educational even to programmers of different languages/platforms.

### What else ?

If you're also a total beginner wanting to set up an AVAudioEngine to start playing music, you will find a bare bones AVAudioEngine setup here. 
< 100 lines of code with just a player that schedules buffers.

## Why ?

It seems that there aren't too many similar beginner-level demo projects or tutorials out there. The few that I found there were much too overwhelming.
I know that I myself searched and researched for almost 3 whole years to finally learn enough to write this basic player demo app.

If there are others like me out there who are dying to harness the awesome power of ffmpeg and develop their own audio apps, I'd like to at least give them enough
to get started on their addictive journey!

I have also shared links to much bigger and more comprehensive/detailed demos/projects/tutorials out there, which I myself learned from.

## Please note ...

This minimalist project is intended only as a quick start guide for beginners wanting to get their hands dirty programming with ffmpeg. 

It is NOT a comprehensive ffmpeg reference.
It is NOT a full-fledged audio player application.
